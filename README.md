# iVMS and Logbook Analysis Tools - Static Gear Fishing


## Applications
This repository contains code and instructions for formatting, cleaning, and analysing 
fishing vessel activity using iVMS and logbook data. Additionally, we include code that can
allow users to knit iVMS and logbook outputs into interpretable PDF reports. 


The code used in the repository's scripts are currently tailored to the
Isle of Man (IoM) static gear fishery, so will need adjusting if used outside of this context.


## Contents
1. **iVMS and Logbook Cleaner**: cleaning and merging raw iVMS and logbook data.
2. **Static Gear Reports**: creating PDF reports for the overall static gear fishery.
3. **Autonomous Vessel Reports**: creating PDF reports for individual vessels.
